# AI-Random-KeyStudy
A research project exploring AI-driven cryptographic key generation using neural networks. Includes code for key generation, randomness testing (e.g., Chi-Square, Runs Test), and analysis against traditional algorithms like RSA/AES. Developed as part of a STEM Senior Project on the future of AI with encryption models.
